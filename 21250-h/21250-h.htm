<h2><a name="Sir_Walter_Scott" id="Sir_Walter_Scott"></a>Sir Walter Scott</h2>


<p>When I was asked to choose a subject for a
lecture at the Sorbonne, there came into my
mind somehow or other the incident of Scott's
visit to Paris when he went to see <i>Ivanhoe</i> at
the Od&eacute;on, and was amused to think how the
story had travelled and made its fortune:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'It was an opera, and, of course, the story sadly
mangled and the dialogue in great part nonsense. Yet
it was strange to hear anything like the words which
(then in an agony of pain with spasms in my stomach)
I dictated to William Laidlaw at Abbotsford, now
recited in a foreign tongue, and for the amusement of
a strange people. I little thought to have survived the
completing of this novel.'</p></div>

<p>It seemed to me that here I had a text for my
sermon. The cruel circumstances of the composition
of <i>Ivanhoe</i> might be neglected. The
interesting point was in the contrast between
the original home of Scott's imagination and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the widespread triumph of his works abroad&mdash;on
the one hand, Edinburgh and Ashestiel, the
traditions of the Scottish border and the Highlands,
the humours of Edinburgh lawyers and
Glasgow citizens, country lairds, farmers and
ploughmen, the Presbyterian eloquence of the
Covenanters and their descendants, the dialect
hardly intelligible out of its own region, and
not always clear even to natives of Scotland; on
the other hand, the competition for Scott's novels
in all the markets of Europe, as to which I take
leave to quote the evidence of Stendhal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Lord Byron, auteur de quelques h&eacute;ro&iuml;des sublimes,
mais toujours les m&ecirc;mes, et de beaucoup de trag&eacute;dies
mortellement ennuyeuses, n'est point du tout le chef
des romantiques.</p>

<p>'S'il se trouvait un homme que les traducteurs &agrave; la
toise se disputassent &eacute;galement &agrave; Madrid, &agrave; Stuttgard,
&agrave; Paris et &agrave; Vienne, l'on pourrait avancer que cet
homme a devin&eacute; les tendances morales de son &eacute;poque.'</p></div>

<p>If Stendhal proceeds to remark in a footnote
that 'l'homme lui-m&ecirc;me est peu digne d'enthousiasme,'
it is pleasant to remember that Lord
Byron wrote to M. Henri Beyle to correct his
low opinion of the character of Scott. This is
by the way, though not, I hope, an irrelevant
remark. For Scott is best revealed in his friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>ships;
and the mutual regard of Scott and Byron
is as pleasant to think of as the friendship between
Scott and Wordsworth.</p>

<p>As to the truth of Stendhal's opinion about
the vogue of Scott's novels and his place as chief
of the romantics, there is no end to the list of
witnesses who might be summoned. Perhaps
it may be enough to remember how the young
Balzac was carried away by the novels as they
came fresh from the translator, almost immediately
after their first appearance at home.</p>

<p>One distinguishes easily enough, at home in
Scotland, between the novels, or the passages in
the novels, that are idiomatic, native, homegrown,
intended for his own people, and the
novels not so limited, the romances of English or
foreign history&mdash;<i>Ivanhoe</i>, <i>Kenilworth</i>, <i>Quentin
Durward</i>. But as a matter of fact these latter,
though possibly easier to understand and
better suited to the general public, were not
invariably preferred. The novels were 'the
Scotch novels.' Although Thackeray, when he
praises Scott, takes most of his examples from
the less characteristic, what we may call the
English group, on the other hand, Hazlitt
dwells most willingly on the Scotch novels,
though he did not like Scotsmen, and shared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
some of the prejudice of Stendhal&mdash;'my friend
Mr. Beyle,' as he calls him in one place&mdash;with
regard to Scott himself. And Balzac has no
invidious preferences: he recommends an English
romance, <i>Kenilworth</i>, to his sister, and he
also remembers David Deans, a person most
intensely and peculiarly Scots.</p>

<p>One may distinguish the Scotch novels, which
only their author could have written, from
novels like <i>Peveril of the Peak</i> or <i>Anne of
Geierstein</i>, which may be thought to resemble
rather too closely the imitations of Scott, the
ordinary historical novel as it was written by
Scott's successors. But though the formula of
the conventional historical novel may have been
drawn from the less idiomatic group, it was not
this that chiefly made Scott's reputation. His
fame and influence were achieved through the
whole mass of his immense and varied work;
and the Scots dialect and humours, which make
so large a part of his resources when he is putting
out all his power, though they have their
difficulties for readers outside of Scotland, were
no real hindrances in the way of the Scotch
novels: Dandie Dinmont and Bailie Nicol
Jarvie, Cuddie Headrigg and Andrew Fairservice
were not ignored or forgotten, even where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<i>Ivanhoe</i> or <i>The Talisman</i> might have the preference
as being more conformable to the general
mind of novel readers.</p>

<p>The paradox remains: that the most successful
novelist of the whole world should have had
his home and found his strength in a country
with a language of its own, barely intelligible,
frequently repulsive to its nearest neighbours, a
language none the more likely to win favour
when the manners or ideas of the country were
taken into consideration as well.</p>

<p>The critics who refuse to see much good in
Scott, for the most part ignore the foundations
of his work. Thus Stendhal, who acknowledges
Scott's position as representative of his age, the
one really great, universally popular, author of
his day, does not recognise in Scott's imagination
much more than trappings and tournaments,
the furniture of the regular historical novel.
He compares Scott's novels with <i>La Princesse
de Cl&egrave;ves</i>, and asks which is more to be praised,
the author who understands and reveals the
human heart, or the descriptive historian who
can fill pages with unessential details but is
afraid of the passions.</p>

<p>In which it seems to be assumed that Scott,
when he gave his attention to the background<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and the appropriate dresses, was neglecting the
dramatic truth of his characters and their expression.
Scott, it may be observed, had, in his
own reflexions on the art of novel-writing, taken
notice of different kinds of policy in dealing
with the historical setting. In his lives of the
novelists, reviewing <i>The Old English Baron</i>,
he describes the earlier type of historical novel
in which little or nothing is done for antiquarian
decoration or for local colour; while in his criticism
of Mrs. Radcliffe he uses the very term&mdash;'melodrama'&mdash;and
the very distinction&mdash;melodrama
as opposed to tragedy&mdash;which is the
touchstone of the novelist. Whatever his success
might be, there can be no doubt as to his
intentions. He meant his novels, with their
richer background and their larger measure of
detail, to sacrifice nothing of dramatic truth.
<i>La Princesse de Cl&egrave;ves</i>, a professedly historical
novel with little 'local colour', may be in essentials
finer and more sincere than Scott. This is
a question which I ask leave to pass over. But
it is not Scott's intention to put off the reader
with details and decoration as a substitute for
truth of character and sentiment. Here most
obviously, with all their differences, Balzac and
Scott are agreed: expensive both of them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
description, but neither of them inclined to let
mere description (in Pope's phrase) take the
place of sense&mdash;i.e. of the life which it is the
business of the novelist to interpret. There is
danger, no doubt, of overdoing it, but description
in Balzac, however full and long, is never
inanimate. He has explained his theory in a
notice of Scott, or rather in a comparison of
Scott and Fenimore Cooper (<i>Revue Parisienne</i>,
1840), where the emptiness of Cooper's novels
is compared with the variety of Scott's, the solitude
of the American lakes and forests with the
crowd of life commanded by the author of
<i>Waverley</i>. Allowing Cooper one great success
in the character of Leather-stocking and
some merit in a few other personages, Balzac
finds beyond these nothing like Scott's multitude
of characters; their place is taken by the beauties
of nature. But description cannot make up for
want of life in a story.</p>

<p>Balzac shows clearly that he understood the
danger of description, and how impossible, how
unreasonable, it is to make scenery do instead of
story and characters. He does not seem to
think that Scott has failed in this respect, while
in his remarks on Scott's humour he proves how
far he is from the critics who found in Scott<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
nothing but scenery and accoutrements and the
rubbish of old chronicles. Scott's chivalry and
romance are not what Balzac is thinking about.
Balzac is considering Scott's imagination in
general, his faculty in narrative and dialogue,
wherever his scene may be, from whatever
period the facts of his story may be drawn.</p>

<p>Scott's superiority to his American rival comes
out, says Balzac, chiefly in his secondary personages
and in his talent for comedy. The American
makes careful mechanical provision for
laughter: Balzac takes this all to pieces, and
leaves Scott unchallenged and inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Scott's reputation has suffered a little through
suspicion of his politics, and, strangely enough,
of his religion. He has been made responsible
for movements in Churches about which opinions
naturally differ, but of which it is certain Scott
never dreamed. Those who suspect and blame
his work because it is reactionary, illiberal, and
offensive to modern ideas of progress, are, of
course, mainly such persons as believe in 'the
march of intellect,' and think meanly of each
successive stage as soon as it is left behind. The
spokesman of this party is Mark Twain, who
wrote a burlesque of the Holy Grail, and who
in his <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> makes Scott<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
responsible for the vanities and superstitions of
the Southern States of America:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'The South has not yet recovered from the debilitating
influence of his books. Admiration of his
fantastic heroes and their grotesque "chivalry" doings
and romantic juvenilities still survives here, in an atmosphere
in which is already perceptible the wholesome
and practical nineteenth century smell of cotton-factories
and locomotives.'</p></div>

<p>It is useless to moralise on this, and the purport
and significance of it may be left for private
meditation to enucleate and enjoy. But it
cannot be fully appreciated, unless one remembers
that the author of this and other charges
against chivalry is also the historian of the feud
between the Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords,
equal in tragedy to the themes of the <i>chansons
de geste</i>: of <i>Raoul de Cambrai</i> or <i>Garin le
Loherain</i>. Mark Twain in the person of
Huckleberry Finn is committed to the ideas
of chivalry neither more nor less than Walter
Scott in <i>Ivanhoe</i> or <i>The Talisman</i>. I am told
further&mdash;though this is perhaps unimportant&mdash;that
Gothic ornament in America is not peculiarly
the taste of the South, that even at Chicago
there are imitations of Gothic towers and halls.</p>

<p>Hazlitt, an unbeliever in most of Scott's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
political principles, is also the most fervent and
expressive admirer of the novels, quite beyond
the danger of modern progress, his judgment
not corrupted at all by the incense of the cotton-factory
or the charm of the locomotive. Hazlitt's
praise of Scott is an immortal proof of
Hazlitt's sincerity in criticism. Scott's friends
were not Hazlitt's, and Scott and Hazlitt differed
both in personal and public affairs as much
as any men of their time. But Hazlitt has too
much sense not to be taken with the Scotch novels,
and too much honesty not to say so, and too much
spirit not to put all his strength into praising,
when once he begins. Hazlitt's critical theory of
Scott's novels is curiously like his opinion about
Scott's old friend, the poet Crabbe: whose name
I cannot leave without a salute to the laborious
and eloquent work of M. Huchon, his scholarly
French interpreter.</p>

<p>Hazlitt on Crabbe and Scott is a very interesting
witness on account of the principles and
presuppositions employed by him. In the last
hundred years or so the problems of realism
and naturalism have been canvassed almost
too thoroughly between disputants who seem
not always to know when they are wandering
from the point or wearying their audience with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
verbiage and platitudes. But out of all the controversy
there has emerged at least one plain
probability&mdash;that there is no such thing as
simple transference of external reality into
artistic form. This is what Hazlitt seems to
ignore very strangely in his judgment of Crabbe
and Scott, and this is, I think, an interesting
point in the history of criticism, especially when
it is remembered that Hazlitt was a critic of
painting, and himself a painter. He speaks
almost as if realities passed direct into the verse
of Crabbe; as if Scott's imagination in the novels
were merely recollection and transcription of experience.
Speaking of the difference between
the genius of Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott,
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'It is the difference between <i>originality</i> and the want
of it, between writing and transcribing. Almost all
the finest scenes and touches, the great master-strokes
in Shakespeare, are such as must have belonged to the
class of invention, where the secret lay between him
and his own heart, and the power exerted is in adding
to the given materials and working something out of
them: in the author of <i>Waverley</i>, not all, but the
principal and characteristic beauties are such as may
and do belong to the class of compilation&mdash;that is,
consist in bringing the materials together and leaving
them to produce their own effect....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>'No one admires or delights in the Scotch Novels
more than I do, but at the same time, when I hear it
asserted that his mind is of the same class with Shakespeare,
or that he imitates nature in the same way, I
confess I cannot assent to it. No two things appear
to me more different. Sir Walter is an imitator of
nature and nothing more; but I think Shakespeare
is infinitely more than this.... Sir Walter's mind is
full of information, but the "<i>o'er informing power</i>" is
not there. Shakespeare's spirit, like fire, shines through
him; Sir Walter's, like a stream, reflects surrounding
objects.'</p></div>

<p>I may not at this time quote much more of
Hazlitt's criticism, but the point of it would be
misunderstood if it were construed as depreciation
of Scott. What may be considered merely
memory in contrast to Shakespeare's imagination
is regarded by Hazlitt as a limitless source
of visionary life when compared with the ideas
of self-centred authors like Byron. This is
what Hazlitt says in another essay of the same
series:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Scott "does not 'spin his brains' but something
much better." He "has got hold of another clue&mdash;that
of Nature and history&mdash;and long may he spin it,
'even to the crack of doom!'" Scott's success lies in
not thinking of himself. "And then again the catch
that blind Willie and his wife and the boy sing in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
hollow of the heath&mdash;there is more mirth and heart's
ease in it than in all Lord Byron's <i>Don Juan</i> or
Mr. Moore's <i>Lyrics</i>. And why? Because the author
is thinking of beggars and a beggar's brat, and not of
himself, while he writes it. He looks at Nature, sees
it, hears it, feels it, and believes that it exists before it
is printed, hotpressed, and labelled on the back <i>By the
Author of</i> '<i>Waverley</i>.' He does not fancy, nor would
he for one moment have it supposed, that his name
and fame compose all that is worth a moment's consideration
in the universe. This is the great secret of
his writings&mdash;a perfect indifference to self."'</p></div>

<p>Hazlitt appears to allow too little to the mind
of the Author of <i>Waverley</i>&mdash;as though the
author had nothing to do but let the contents
of his mind arrange themselves on his pages.
What this exactly may mean is doubtful. We
are not disposed to accept the theory of the passive
mind as a sufficient philosophical explanation
of the Scotch novels. But Hazlitt is
certainly right to make much of the store of
reading and reminiscence they imply, and it is
not erroneous or fallacious to think of all Scott's
writings in verse or prose as peculiarly the fruits
of his life and experience. His various modes
of writing are suggested to him by the way, and
he finds his art with no long practice when the
proper time comes to use it. After all, is this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
not what was meant by Horace when he said
that the subject rightly chosen will provide what
is wanted in art and style?</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="indented">Cui lecta potenter erit res</span><br />
Nec facundia deseret hunc nec lucidus ordo.</p>

<p>It was chosen by Corneille as a motto for
<i>Cinna</i>; it would do as a summary of all the
writings of Scott.</p>

<p>The Waverley Novels may be reckoned
among the works of fiction that have had their
origin in chance, and have turned out something
different from what the author intended. Reading
the life of Scott, we seem to be following a
pilgrimage where the traveller meets with different
temptations and escapes various dangers,
and takes up a number of duties, and is led to
do a number of fine things which he had not
thought of till the time came for attempting
them. The poet and the novelist are revealed
in the historian and the collector of antiquities.
Scott before <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> looked
like a young adventurer in the study of history
and legend, who had it in him to do solid work
on a large scale (like his edition of Dryden) if
he chose to take it up. He is not a poet from
the beginning like Wordsworth and Keats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
devoted to that one service; he turns novelist
late in life when the success of his poetry seems
to be over. His early experiments in verse are
queerly suggested and full of hazard. It needs
a foreign language&mdash;German&mdash;to encourage him
to rhyme. The fascination of B&uuml;rger's <i>Lenore</i>
is a reflection from English ballad poetry; the
reflected image brought out what had been less
remarkable in the original. The German devices
of terror and wonder are a temptation to
Scott; they hang about his path with their
monotonous and mechanical jugglery, their
horrors made all the more intolerable through
the degraded verse of Lewis&mdash;a bad example
which Scott instinctively refused to follow,
though he most unaccountably praised Lewis's
sense of rhythm. The close of the eighteenth
century cannot be fully understood, nor the
progress of poetry in the nineteenth, without
some study of the plague of ghosts and
skeletons which has left its mark on <i>The Ancient
Mariner</i>, from which Goethe and Scott did not
escape, which imposed on Shelley in his youth,
to which Byron yielded his tribute of <i>The Vampire</i>.
A tempting subject for expatiation,
especially when one remembers&mdash;and who that
has once read it can forget?&mdash;the most glorious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
passage in the <i>Memoirs</i> of Alexandre Dumas
describing his first conversation with the unknown
gentleman who afterwards turned out to
be Charles Nodier, in the theatre of the Porte
Saint-Martin where the play was the <i>Vampire</i>:
from which theatre Charles Nodier was expelled
for hissing the <i>Vampire</i>, himself being part-author
of the marvellous drama. I hope it is
not impertinent in a stranger to express his
unbounded gratitude for that delightful and
most humorous dialogue, in which the history of
the Elzevir Press (starting from <i>Le Pastissier
fran&ccedil;ois</i>) and the tragedy of the rotifer are so
adroitly interwoven with the theatrical scene of
Fingal's Cave and its unusual visitors, the whole
adventure ending in the happiest laughter over
the expulsion of the dramatist. I may not have
any right to say so, but I throw myself on the
mercy of my hearers: I remember nothing in
any chronicle so mercurial or jovial in its high
spirits as this story of the first encounter and
the beginning of friendship between Charles
Nodier and Alexandre Dumas.</p>

<p>The Vampire of Staffa may seem rather far
from the range of Scott's imagination; but his
contributions to Lewis's <i>Tales of Wonder</i> show
the risk that he ran, while the White Lady of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Avenel in <i>The Monastery</i> proves that even in
his best years he was exposed to the hazards of
conventional magic.</p>

<p>Lockhart has given the history of <i>The Lay of
the Last Minstrel</i>, how the story developed and
took shape. It is not so much an example of
Scott's mode of writing poetry as an explanation
of his whole literary life. <i>The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</i> was his first original piece of any
length and his first great popular success. And,
as Lockhart has sufficiently shown, it was impossible
for Scott to get to it except through the
years of exploration and editing, the collection
of the Border ballads, the study of the old
metrical romance of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>. The story
of the Goblin Page was at first reckoned enough
simply for one of the additions to the Border
Minstrelsy on the scale of a ballad. Scott had
tried another sort of imitation in the stanzas
composed in old English and in the metre of the
original to supply the missing conclusion of <i>Sir
Tristrem</i>. It was not within his scope to write
an original romance in the old language, but Coleridge's
<i>Christabel</i> was recited to him, and gave
him a modern rhythm fit for a long story. So
the intended ballad became the <i>Lay</i>, taking in,
with the legend of Gilpin Horner for a founda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>tion,
all the spirit of Scott's knowledge of his
own country.</p>

<p>Here I must pause to express my admiration
for Lockhart's criticism of Scott, and particularly
for his description of the way in which the <i>Lay</i>
came to be written. It is really wonderful,
Lockhart's sensible, unpretentious, thorough
interpretation of the half-unconscious processes
by which Scott's reading and recollections were
turned into his poems and novels. Of course,
it is all founded on Scott's own notes and introductions.</p>

<p>What happened with the <i>Lay</i> is repeated a
few years afterwards in <i>Waverley</i>. The <i>Lay</i>,
a rhyming romance; <i>Waverley</i> an historical
novel; what, it may be asked, is so very remarkable
about their origins? Was it not open to
any one to write romances in verse or prose?
Perhaps; but the singularity of Scott's first
romances in verse and prose is that they do not
begin as literary experiments, but as means of
expressing their author's knowledge, memory
and treasured sentiment. Hazlitt is right;
Scott's experience is shaped into the Waverley
Novels, though one can distinguish later between
those stories that belong properly to Scott's life and
those that are invented in repetition of a pattern.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Scott's own alleged reason for giving up the
writing of tales in verse was that Byron beat
him. But there must have been something
besides this: it is plain that the pattern of
rhyming romance was growing stale. The <i>Lay</i>
needs no apology; <i>Marmion</i> includes the great
tragedy of Scotland in the Battle of Flodden:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">The stubborn spearmen still made good<br />
Their dark impenetrable wood,<br />
Each stepping where his comrade stood,<br />
<span class="flodden">The instant that he fell.</span><br />
No thought was there of dastard flight;<br />
Link'd in the serried phalanx tight,<br />
Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,<br />
<span class="flodden">As fearlessly and well;</span><br />
Till utter darkness closed her wing<br />
O'er their thin host and wounded king.</p>

<p>And <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> is all that the Highlands
meant for Scott at that time. But <i>Rokeby</i>
has little substance, though it includes more than
one of Scott's finest songs. <i>The Lord of the
Isles</i>, though its battle is not too far below <i>Marmion</i>,
and though its hero is Robert the Bruce,
yet wants the original force of the earlier
romances. When Scott changed his hand from
verse to prose for story-telling and wrote
<i>Waverley</i>, he not only gained in freedom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
got room for a kind of dialogue that was impossible
in rhyme, but he came back to the same
sort of experience and the same strength of
tradition as had given life to the <i>Lay</i>. The
time of <i>Waverley</i> was no more than sixty
years since, when Scott began to write it and
mislaid and forgot the opening chapters in 1805;
he got his ideas of the Forty-five from an old
Highland gentleman who had been out with the
Highland clans, following the lead of Prince
Charles Edward, the Young Chevalier. The
clans in that adventure belonged to a world more
ancient than that of <i>Ivanhoe</i> or <i>The Talisman</i>;
they also belonged so nearly to Scott's
own time that he heard their story from one of
themselves. He had spoken and listened to
another gentleman who had known Rob Roy.
<i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> came to him as
the Icelandic family histories came to the historians
of Gunnar or Kjartan Olafsson. He
had known the story all his life, and he wrote it
from tradition. The time of <i>The Heart of
Midlothian</i> is earlier than <i>Waverley</i>, but it is
more of a modern novel than an historical
romance, and even <i>Old Mortality</i>, which is
earlier still, is modern also; Cuddie Headrigg
is no more antique than Dandie Dinmont or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Ettrick Shepherd himself, and even his mother
and her Covenanting friends are not far from the
fashion of some enthusiasts of Scott's own time&mdash;e.g.
Hogg's religious uncle who could not be
brought to repeat his old ballads for thinking
of 'covenants broken, burned and buried.'
<i>Guy Mannering</i> and <i>The Antiquary</i> are both
modern stories: it is not till <i>Ivanhoe</i> that
Scott definitely starts on the regular historical
novel in the manner that was found so easy to
imitate.</p>

<p>If <i>Rob Roy</i> is not the very best of them all&mdash;and
on problems of that sort perhaps the right
word may be the Irish phrase <i>Naboclish!</i> ('don't
trouble about that!') which Scott picked up
when he was visiting Miss Edgeworth in Ireland&mdash;<i>Rob
Roy</i> shows well enough what Scott
could do, in romance of adventure and in
humorous dialogue. The plots of his novels
are sometimes thought to be loose and ill-defined,
and he tells us himself that he seldom
knew where his story was carrying him. His
young heroes are sometimes reckoned rather
feeble and featureless. Francis Osbaldistone,
like Edward Waverley and Henry Morton,
drifts into trouble and has his destiny shaped for
him by other people and accidents. But is this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
anything of a reproach to the author of the
story? Then it must tell against some novelists
who seem to work more conscientiously and
carefully than Scott on the frame of their story&mdash;against
George Meredith in Evan Harrington
and Richard Feverel and Harry Richmond,
all of whom are driven by circumstances and see
their way no more clearly than Scott's young
men. Is it not really the strength, not the weakness,
of Scott's imagination that engages us in
the perplexities of Waverley and Henry Morton
even to the verge of tragedy&mdash;keeping out of
tragedy because it is not his business, and would
spoil his looser, larger, more varied web of a
story? Francis Osbaldistone is less severely
tried. His story sets him travelling, and may
we not admire the skill of the author who uses
the old device of a wandering hero with such
good effect? The story is not a mere string of
adventures&mdash;it is adventures with a bearing on
the main issue, with complications that all tell in
the end; chief among them, of course, the successive
appearances of Mr. Campbell and the
counsels of Diana Vernon. The scenes that
bring out Scott's genius most completely&mdash;so
they have always seemed to me&mdash;are those of
Francis Osbaldistone's stay in Glasgow. Seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
has any novelist managed so easily so many different
modes of interest. There is the place&mdash;in
different lights&mdash;the streets, the river, the
bridge, the Cathedral, the prison, seen through
the suspense of the hero's mind, rendered in the
talk of Bailie Nicol Jarvie and Andrew Fairservice;
made alive, as the saying is, through
successive anxieties and dangers; thrilling with
romance, yet at the same time never beyond the
range of ordinary common sense. Is it not a
triumph, at the very lowest reckoning, of dexterous
narrative to bring together in a vivid
dramatic scene the humorous character of the
Glasgow citizen and the equal and opposite
humour of his cousin, the cateran, the Highland
loon, Mr. Campbell disclosed as Rob Roy&mdash;with
the Dougal creature helping him?</p>

<p>Scott's comedy is like that of Cervantes
in <i>Don Quixote</i>&mdash;humorous dialogue independent
of any definite comic plot and mixed up
with all sorts of other business. Might not
Falstaff himself be taken into comparison too?
Scott's humorous characters are nowhere and
never characters in a comedy&mdash;and Falstaff, the
greatest comic character in Shakespeare, is not
great in comedy.</p>

<p>Some of the rich idiomatic Scottish dialogue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the novels might be possibly disparaged (like
Ben Jonson) as 'mere humours and observation.'
Novelists of lower rank than Scott&mdash;Galt
in <i>The Ayrshire Legatees</i> and <i>Annals
of the Parish</i> and <i>The Entail</i>&mdash;have nearly
rivalled Scott in reporting conversation. But
the Bailie at any rate has his part to play in the
story of <i>Rob Roy</i>&mdash;and so has Andrew Fairservice.
Scott never did anything more ingenious
than his contrast of those two characters&mdash;so
much alike in language, and to some extent
in cast of mind, with the same conceit and self-confidence,
the same garrulous Westland
security in their own judgment, both attentive
to their own interests, yet clearly and absolutely
distinct in spirit, the Bailie a match in courage
for Rob Roy himself.</p>

<p>Give me leave, before I end, to read one
example of Scott's language: from the scene in
<i>Guy Mannering</i> where Dandie Dinmont explains
his case to Mr. Pleydell the advocate.
It is true to life: memory and imagination here
indistinguishable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dinmont, who had pushed after Mannering into
the room, began with a scrape of his foot and a
scratch of his head in unison. 'I am Dandie
Dinmont, sir, of the Charlies-hope&mdash;the Liddesdale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lad&mdash;ye'll mind me? It was for me you won yon
grand plea.'</p>

<p>'What plea, you loggerhead?' said the lawyer; 'd'ye
think I can remember all the fools that come to
plague me?'</p>

<p>'Lord, sir, it was the grand plea about the grazing o'
the Langtae-head,' said the farmer.</p>

<p>'Well, curse thee, never mind;&mdash;give me the
memorial, and come to me on Monday at ten,' replied
the learned counsel.</p>

<p>'But, sir, I haena got ony distinct memorial.'</p>

<p>'No memorial, man?' said Pleydell.</p>

<p>'Na, sir, nae memorial,' answered Dandie; 'for your
honour said before, Mr. Pleydell, ye'll mind, that ye
liked best to hear us hill-folk tell our ane tale by word
o' mouth.'</p>

<p>'Beshrew my tongue that said so!' answered the
counsellor; 'it will cost my ears a dinning.&mdash;Well, say
in two words what you've got to say&mdash;you see the
gentleman waits.'</p>

<p>'Ou, sir, if the gentleman likes he may play his ain
spring first; it's a' ane to Dandie.'</p>

<p>'Now, you looby,' said the lawyer, 'cannot you conceive
that your business can be nothing to Colonel
Mannering, but that he may not choose to have these
great ears of thine regaled with his matters?'</p>

<p>'Aweel, sir, just as you and he like, so ye see to
my business,' said Dandie, not a whit disconcerted by
the roughness of this reception. 'We're at the auld
wark o' the marches again, Jock o' Dawston Cleugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and me. Ye see we march on the tap o' Touthoprigg
after we pass the Pomoragrains; for the Pomoragrains,
and Slackenspool, and Bloodylaws, they come
in there, and they belang to the Peel; but after ye
pass Pomoragrains at a muckle great saucer-headed
cutlugged stane, that they ca' Charlie's Chuckie, there
Dawston Cleugh and Charlies-hope they march.
Now, I say, the march rins on the tap o' the hill
where the wind and water shears; but Jock o' Dawston
Cleugh again, he contravenes that, and says that it
hauds down by the auld drove-road that gaes awa by
the Knot o' the Gate ower to Keeldar-ward&mdash;and that
makes an unco difference.'</p>

<p>'And what difference does it make, friend?' said
Pleydell. 'How many sheep will it feed?'</p>

<p>'Ou, no mony,' said Dandie, scratching his head;
'it's lying high and exposed&mdash;it may feed a hog, or
aiblins twa in a good year.'</p>

<p>'And for this grazing, which may be worth about
five shillings a-year, you are willing to throw away
a hundred pound or two?'</p>

<p>'Na, sir, it's no for the value of the grass,' replied
Dinmont; 'it's for justice.'</p></div>

<p>Do we at home in Scotland make too much
of Scott's life and associations when we think
of his poetry and his novels? Possibly few
Scotsmen are impartial here. As Dr. Johnson
said, they are not a fair people, and when they
think of the Waverley Novels they perhaps do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
not always see quite clearly. Edinburgh and
the Eildon Hills, Aberfoyle and Stirling, come
between their minds and the printed page:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">A mist of memory broods and floats,<br />
<span class="eildon">The Border waters flow,</span><br />
The air is full of ballad notes<br />
<span class="eildon">Borne out of long ago.</span></p>

<p>It might be prudent and more critical to take
each book on its own merits in a dry light. But
it is not easy to think of a great writer thus
discreetly. Is Balzac often judged accurately
and coldly, piece by piece, here a line and there
a line? Are not the best judges those who
think of his whole achievement altogether&mdash;the
whole amazing world of his creation&mdash;<i>La
Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>? By the same sort of rule
Scott may be judged, and the whole of his work,
his vast industry, and all that made the fabric of
his life, be allowed to tell on the mind of the
reader.</p>

<p>I wish this discourse had been more worthy
of its theme, and of this audience, and of this
year of heroic memories and lofty hopes. But
if, later in the summer, I should find my way
back to Ettrick and Yarrow and the Eildon
Hills, it will be a pleasure to remember there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the honour you have done me in allowing me
to speak in Paris, however unworthily, of the
greatness of Sir Walter Scott.</p>
